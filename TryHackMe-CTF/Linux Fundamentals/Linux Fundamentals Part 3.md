Now, use Python 3's "HTTPServer" module to start a web server in the home directory of the "tryhackme" user on the deployed instance.
```
No answer needed
```

Download the file http://MACHINE_IP:8000/.flag.txt onto the TryHackMe AttackBox
What are the contents?
```
THM{WGET_WEBSERVER}
```

Create and download files to further apply your learning -- see how you can read the documentation on Python3's "HTTPServer" module.
